Here's a dictionary based [word squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square) generator I wrote in Perl. Actually it's my first script and I'm still in the middle of Learning Perl, 4th edition by Tom Phoenix, Randal Schwartz, brian foy while writing this but I thought I could give it a try. Currently it expects 2 parameters (word length and first letter of a word) and a dictionary (text file containing one word per line). 

## To-do list

* boost speed by replacing "brute force" approach with more intelligent solution
* clean up parameters part
* utf-8 characters support

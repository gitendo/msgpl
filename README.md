Here's a dictionary based [word squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square) generator I wrote in Perl. Actually it's my first script and I'm still in the middle of Learning Perl, 4th edition by Tom Phoenix, Randal Schwartz, brian foy while writing this but I thought I could give it a try. Currently it expects 2 parameters (word length, first letter of a word) and a dictionary (text file containing one word per line). Then it tries to match proper words to form valid word squares. The longer word the more time it takes to get final results... unless you have badass CPU. ;)

## To-do list

* add utf-8 characters support
